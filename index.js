/*show a button that allows user to add a todolist
once pressed, have the background fade out and a new page 
pop out that allows the user to insert a title and
a task
Once reached the end of the container, have the cards flow
downwards
After this is completed, have a history page for deleted,
and incomplete tasks
- with the history, have a dropdown that shows all, incomplete, deleted
Maybe create a priority tag for tasks as well
